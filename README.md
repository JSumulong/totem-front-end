# Totem Front End

## Purpose
The front end side of Project Totem is a native Android application that allows users to find other users in augmented reality. This project was designed to allow the contributing members an opportunity to learn new technology at a rapid pace under the pressure of an eight day time constraint and with the expectation of presenting a working demo during the 2016 Coyotes graduation ceremony.

## Dependencies
